# Proof of Carbon Reduction public blockchain network

"Proof of Carbon Reduction" is the name of an augmented proof of authority consensus inherited from Ethereum Clique that incentivizes with the Carbon Reduction Coin (CRC / ₡) the node operators to progressively improve the carbon footprint of their node.

_Expected benefits:_
* The total carbon footprint of the network of nodes (block sealers) will be known at all time and is expected to progressively reduce with time (given a constant number of nodes)
* Sealers will be financially incentivized to better understand Green IT parameters and make investments for developping that sector
* Sealers are publicly known so crypto tokens generated and allocated to nodes are be traceable from source to recipient reducing the risk for illegal activities to benefit from the CRC.
* Fully compatible Ethereum Virtual Machine to leverage the Ethereum ecosystem

**This site contains the necessary material to understand and participate to the Proof of Carbon Reduction network.**

Understand the details of the model with the [whitepaper](https://github.com/ethereum-pocr/whitepaper).

This new public blockchain network is intended for any end users, consumers of blockchain infrastructure, using the CRC (Carbon Reduction Coin / ₡) to pay for transactions.

The main network (or production network) is named `PoCRNet` and is soon to be available to any users.

The test network, `Kerleano`, is available to anyone to join as client and propose sealers --> [**Get Started**](https://github.com/ethereum-pocr/kerleano/tree/main/docs)    

Nodes in charge of adding transactions into blocks are "sealers" of the proof of authority consensus. They are companies (large or small) that are endorsed by the initial sealers. They receive a remuneration in CRC according to the quality of their IT system involved in running their node.    
To participate to the network as sealer, submit your request to the community [here](https://github.com/ethereum-pocr/pocrnet/issues/new/choose).

To visualize the network you have the PoCR Network governance DApp at https://ethereum-pocr.github.io/. It requires a metamask compatible wallet.

The decisions in the community are decided by democratic vote among the nodes operators where one node has one vote. Review the governance part of the whitepaper for more information.
